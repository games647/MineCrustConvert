This simple rust program converts Minecraft premium (online mode) UUIDs to cracked ones. By extracting the lastKnownName
NBT Tag from the user .dat file we could generate a new UUID which is based only on the name. This can be useful if
you want to switch your server to offline mode, but don't want install a extra java plugin to convert the inventory,
speed, flying, ... player dat file.
